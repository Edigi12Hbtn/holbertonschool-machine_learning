    Function that performs PCA on a dataset.

    - X is a numpy.ndarray of shape (n, d) where:
        - n is the number of data points.
        - d is the number of dimensions in each point.
        - all dimensions have a mean of 0 across all data points.
    - var is the fraction of the variance that the PCA
      transformation should maintain.

    Returns: the weights matrix, W, that maintains var
             fraction of Xâ€˜s original variance.
        - W is a numpy.ndarray of shape (d, nd) where nd
          is the new dimensionality of the transformed X.
